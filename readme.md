# Learn the Reactive Extensions for JavaScript (RxJS) with RxJS Koans #

The Koans walk you along the path to enlightenment in order to learn [RxJS](https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxJS). The goal is to learn the RxJS library. We also teach you culture. Testing is not just something we pay lip service to, but something we live. It is essential in your quest to learn and do great things in the library.

## Structure ##

The koans are broken out into areas by file, events are covered in about_events.js, time is introduced in about_time.rb, etc. They are presented in order in the index.js file.

Each koan builds up your knowledge of RxJS and builds upon itself.

Some koans simply need to have the correct answer substituted for an incorrect one. Some, however, require you to supply your own answer. If you see the method __ (a double underscore) listed, it is a hint to you to supply your own code in order to make it work correctly.

## Installing Node.js ##

In order to run the koans you need Node.js installed. If you do not already have Node.js set up, please visit  the [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) site to install Node.js.

To verify your installation, in your terminal window simply type:
```bash
$ node --version
```
Any response for Ruby with a version number greater than 0.10.x is fine.
